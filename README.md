The client's Machine Name will be listed on the [dashboard](https://remote-restart.web.app) and can be restarted if the program is active.


## Notes
- There will be a popup where you can cancel the restart if you clicked restart accidentally (for a few seconds).

- The IDs will be saved to local store on the device where it was added, so if you want to use another device as a trigger, you'll have to visit the website and insert the machine code again.

- Leaking your unique ID means someone else might be able to restart your PC, so avoid being pranked.
